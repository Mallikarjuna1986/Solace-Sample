= SAP Enterprise Messaging JMS: Publish and Subscribe
:toc:

Sample application of how to use the JMS client to send and receive messages using a topic via SAP Cloud Platform Enterprise Messaging.

== Prerequisites

  * Installed _Java 8_ -> link:https://java.com/de/download/[Java download]
  * Installed _Git_ -> link:https://git-scm.com/downloads[Git download]
  * Installed _Maven 3.x_ -> link:https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven download]
  * Optional: Installed Postman
  * A _SAP CP_ Account with `Enterprise Messaging Service` is required. +
    For more detailed information and help on how to start with _SAP Cloud Platform Enterprise Messaging_ please check the link:https://help.sap.com/viewer/bf82e6b26456494cbdd197057c09979f/Cloud/en-US/df532e8735eb4322b00bfc7e42f84e8d.html[SAP help page].
    ** Optional: Installed _CloudFoundry CLI_ -> link:https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html[Installing the cf CLI] 
    *** This must be also fully configured with the corresponding Cloud Foundry landscape to be able to do a `cf push`.
    ** Created Enterprise Messaging Instance 
    *** e.g. via cli: `cf cs enterprise-messaging default emjapi-samples-sapcp -c` link:./config/[`<contents of default descriptor>`]
    *** The Service Descriptors can be found link:https://help.sap.com/viewer/bf82e6b26456494cbdd197057c09979f/Cloud/en-US/d0483a9e38434f23a4579d6fcc72654b.html[here]
    *** Remember to adjust the manifest file of the application
    ** Create queues (e.g. `NameOfQueue`) and subscribe a queue to a topic of choice (e.g. `NameOfTopic`) via e.g.    link:https://help.sap.com/viewer/bf82e6b26456494cbdd197057c09979f/Cloud/en-US/57af1bd4e8f54b0a9b36414a5ec6b800.html?q=messaging%20management[MM API],

    *** For queue creation with the MM API you need to provide a fully qualified queue name including the namespace

=== Recommended

  * Installed IDE of choice (e.g. link:https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio] with installed link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.java[Java language support] plugin)

== Project

The publish and subscribe (pubsub) sample is a small spring boot (version 2.0.6) applications which provides three different REST endpoints to send and receive messages from a topic. 

=== Steps to Start

  . Check all _Prerequisites_ fulfilled (see section _Prerequisites_ above)
  . Clone the repository via `git clone`
  . Build the project with maven (`mvn clean install`)
  . Push to Cloud Foundry via `cf push` (*if the service was renamed please adopt the manifest accordingly*)

=== Steps to Use

 * The queue name has to be URL encoded. The samples provide a function to URL encode
  ** `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -H "Cache-Control: no-cache" -d "https://<application-path>/encode"`(the body must contain the queue name)
  * Send a message with a HTTP POST via https://<application-path>/topic/<topic-name>/message (The body must contain the message)
  ** Note that a client or a queue must be subscribed to the topic before
  ** The queue name has to be url encoded. The
 ** `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -H "Cache-Control: no-cache" -d '<message>' "https://<application-path>/topic/<topic-name>/message"`
  * Receive a message via a queue with a HTTP GET via https://<application-path>/queue/<queue-name>/message
  ** Note that a queue subscription is needed before. A queue subscription can be created via e.G. the UI.
  ** `curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -H "Cache-Control: no-cache" "https://<application-path>/queue/<queue-name>/message"`

=== Code Snippets

In order to use the messaging service the spring cloud service connector can be used to receive a `MessagingServiceFactory`.

```java
ServiceConnectorConfig config = null; // currently there are no configurations for the MessagingServiceFactory supported
Cloud cloud = new CloudFactory().getCloud();
// get a messaging service factory via the service connector
MessagingService messagingService = cloud.getSingletonServiceConnector(MessagingService.class, config);
```

Create a the `MessagingServiceFactory` object with the help of the `MessagingServiceFactoryCreator` and get a `MessagingServiceJmsConnectionFactory`.
The Connection Factory can be configured with the `MessagingServiceJmsSettings`. In case the reconnection feature is not needed and an individual 
connection mechanism (e.G. through a connection cache) is used the settings can be skipped. The connection factory can be built with 
`messagingServiceFactory.createConnectionFactory(MessagingServiceJmsConnectionFactory.class,settings)`.

```java
MessagingServiceJmsSettings settings = new MessagingServiceJmsSettings(); // settings are preset with default values (see JavaDoc)
settings.setMaxReconnectAttempts(5); // use -1 for unlimited attempts
settings.setInitialReconnectDelay(3000);
settings.setReconnectDelay(3000);
MessagingServiceFactory messagingServiceFactory = MessagingServiceFactoryCreator.createFactory(messagingService);
MessagingServiceJmsConnectionFactory connectionFactory = messagingServiceFactory.createConnectionFactory(MessagingServiceJmsConnectionFactory.class, settings)
```

==== Sending
For sending messages a `Connection` and a `Session` is needed first. Note that those resources must be closed if they are not needed anymore. As those objects are implementing the `autoclosable` interface they will be closed automatically after the try-catch-block. Now a `BytesMessage` can be created. In the next steps a topic is bound (not created) to a  producer. Note, that the prefix "topic:" is mandatory. Finally, the message can be sent to the topic.

```java
try (Connection connection = connectionFactory.createConnection();Session session = connection.createSession(false, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE)) {
	connection.start();
	Topic topic = session.createTopic("topic:" + "<topic-name>");
	BytesMessage byteMessage = session.createBytesMessage();
	byteMessage.writeBytes(message.getBytes());
	MessageProducer producer = session.createProducer(topic);
	producer.send(byteMessage);
} catch (JMSException e) {
	LOG.error("Could not send message={}.", message, e);
}
```

==== Receiving
Currently direct topic subscription is *not supported for the plan default*.
In this example a consumer is subscribed to a specific topic. Again a `Connection` and a `Session` is needed. Note that those resources must be closed if they are not needed anymore. First a topic (not created) with the mandatory prefix "topic:" is bound to consumer. As the messages are sent as a `ByteMassage` the message needs to be converted to e.g. a `String`


```java
 try (Connection connection = connectionFactory.createConnection();Session session = connection.createSession(false, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE)) {
	connection.start();
	Topic topic = session.createTopic(TOPIC_PREFIX + topicName);
	MessageConsumer consumer = session.createConsumer(topic);
	// Blocking call. Define a timeout or use a Message Listener
	BytesMessage message = (BytesMessage) consumer.receive(); 
	byte[] byteData = new byte[(int) message.getBodyLength()];
	message.readBytes(byteData);
} catch (JMSException e) {
	LOG.error("Could not receive message.", e);
}
```

== Messaging Management API
The messaging management api (MM API) provides functionality for creating, deleting and updating queues and queue subscriptions.
Further more it provides APIs to get information on queues and queue subscriptions.
The MM API documentation can be found link:https://help.sap.com/doc/75c9efd00fc14183abc4c613490c53f4/Cloud/en-US/rest-management-messaging.html[here]. 
The MM APIs have to be enabled in the service descriptor. A description for enabling the MM API can be found link:https://help.sap.com/viewer/bf82e6b26456494cbdd197057c09979f/Cloud/en-US/d0483a9e38434f23a4579d6fcc72654b.html[here].

== Creation of queues with the UI
Queues can be created through the SAP Cloud Platform Cockpit UI.
More information regarding the creation of queues through the UI can be found link:https://help.sap.com/viewer/bf82e6b26456494cbdd197057c09979f/Cloud/en-US/57af1bd4e8f54b0a9b36414a5ec6b800.html[here]

== Service Descriptor
Examples for the different service descriptors can be found link:https://help.sap.com/viewer/bf82e6b26456494cbdd197057c09979f/Cloud/en-US/d0483a9e38434f23a4579d6fcc72654b.html[here] on the help site
and in the config folder of this project.
